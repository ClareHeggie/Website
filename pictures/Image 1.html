So let’s start at the beginning &#8211; where did the Toy Poodle originate?</p>
<h2>History and original purpose of the Toy Poodle</h2>
<p>The first thing you need to know about the Toy Poodle breed is&#8230; it isn&#8217;t a breed!</p>
<p>In the USA, the UK and Australia, the debonair Poodle comes in three sizes: Standard Poodles, Miniature Poodles and Toy Poodles.</p>
<p>And these three sizes are all categories of the same breed – the Poodle – rather than distinct breeds in their own right.</p>
<div class="blockquote2">Trouble naming your pint-sized pup? <a href="https://thehappypuppysite.com/small-dog-names/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here to find the very best small dog names</a>!</div>
<p>Therefore, to find the history of the Toy Poodle, we need to look at the Poodle breed as a whole.</p>
<h2>Poodle History</h2>
<p>Poodles are often thought of as a quintessentially French dog, but they actually originate from Germany.</p>
<p>There they were originally bred as retrievers for fetching ducks and other waterfowl from the water.</p>
<p>Poodles are derived from Barbets – French water dogs which are still around today.</p>
<p>Barbets are pretty big, so unsurprisingly the Standard Poodle was the first size of Poodle to be recognized in it&#8217;s own right.</p>
<h2>So What About Toy Poodles?</h2>
<p>Miniature and Toy Poodles were created by gradually scaling down the Standard Poodle. This was first done for specific hunting tasks.</p>
<p>But changed to breed them for companionship.<br />
<a name="facts"></a><br />
Toy Poodles aren&#8217;t a recent development, in fact they&#8217;re widely documented as far back as the 18th Century!</p>
<h2>Fun facts About Toy Poodles</h2>
<p>Poodles are loved by everyone throughout history.</p>
<p>In fact they’ve even been a popular pet for celebrities and royalty!</p>
<p>Elvis was one of these well known Poodle lovers! He adored Poodles so much he often gave them as gifts to his loved ones.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6401" src="https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/poodle-1.jpg" alt="toy poodle" width="1200" height="650" srcset="https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/poodle-1.jpg 1200w, https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/poodle-1-300x163.jpg 300w, https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/poodle-1-768x416.jpg 768w, https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/poodle-1-1024x555.jpg 1024w, https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/poodle-1-740x400.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>He gave an early girlfriend a Toy Poodle called Little Bit, gave his mother a Toy Poodle named Duke, and gave his wife Priscilla Presley a Toy Poodle called Honey!<br />
<a name="appearance"></a><br />
Can you think of any other famous Toy Poodle owners?</p>
<h2>Toy Poodle Appearance</h2>
<p>So we’ve seen that the only difference between Toy Poodles and their larger counterparts is their size.</p>
<p>However let’s take a closer look at the Toy Poodle’s full appearance.</p>
<h3>Height</h3>
<p>So what is the magic tipping point when a Miniature Poodle becomes a Toy Poodle?</p>
<p>For a more in-depth look <a href="https://thehappypuppysite.com/toy-poodle-vs-miniature-poodle/">check out our Toy Poodle vs Miniature Poodle comparison</a>.</p>
<p>By the American Kennel Club (AKC) definition, Toy Poodles are Poodles less than 10 inches (25cm) tall at the shoulders. Whereas Miniature Poodles can measure up to 15 inches.</p>
<p>That puts our curly toy breed on the same scale as other toy dog favorites, Pugs and Shih Tzus.</p>
<p>In the show ring, where two Toy Poodles are equal in all other respects, the smaller dog will take the rosette.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re getting a Toy Poodle and want a name that reflects this tiny size, check out our <a href="https://thehappypuppysite.com/small-dog-names/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article on small dog names.</a></p>
<h3>Weight</h3>
<p>We’ve looked at size, but how much should such a small breed weigh?</p>
<p>Generally, healthy Toy Poodles will weigh between 4 and 6 pounds.</p>
<p>This, again, is less than a Miniature Poodle, who should weigh in between 10 and 15 pounds.</p>
<h3>General Appearance</h3>
<p>Generally your Toy Poodle should appear squarely built and well proportioned.</p>
<p>They have dark, oval eyes and their ears hang close to their heads.</p>
<p>Toy Poodles have long, straight muzzles, and of course a very distinctive coat.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at their coat in more detail.</p>
<h3>Coat Type</h3>
<p>Poodles have earned their reputation for being high maintenance in one crucial area: grooming.</p>
<p>Poodle coats don&#8217;t shed, but they do keep growing throughout a dog&#8217;s lifetime.<br />
Left to their own devices, they will eventually “cord” – the canine equivalent of dreadlocks.</p>
<p>Your Toy Poodle&#8217;s coat will need brushing every day to keep on top of tangles and sweep away dirt and debris before it can accumulate.</p>
<p>It will also need trimming every six to eight weeks.</p>
<p>For most Toy Poodles owners, this is as straightforward as an all-over haircut, known as a pet clip or a puppy clip.</p>
<p>We’ll look more at grooming later on.</p>
<h3>Coat Colors</h3>
<p>The AKC recognizes a staggering ten standard Poodle colors:</p>
<ul>
<li>apricot</li>
<li>black</li>
<li>blue</li>
<li>brown</li>
<li>cream</li>
<li>gray</li>
<li>red</li>
<li>silver</li>
<li>silver beige</li>
<li>and white!</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, they list an astonishing eighteen acceptable two-tone coat combinations in their breed standard.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6398" src="https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/poodle5.jpg" alt="toy poodle" width="1200" height="1387" srcset="https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/poodle5.jpg 1200w, https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/poodle5-260x300.jpg 260w, https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/poodle5-768x888.jpg 768w, https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/poodle5-886x1024.jpg 886w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>And if that&#8217;s not enough already, whilst looking for a Toy Poodle puppy you&#8217;ll probably encounter even more colors, which aren&#8217;t recognized by the breed registries, but look just as sharp.<br />
<a name="temperament"></a><br />
So no matter what color Poodle you picture having, with a little patience and perseverance you&#8217;ve got a good chance of finding them.</p>
<h2>Toy Poodle Temperament</h2>
<p>Toy Poodles really do bear the brunt of two unfair stereotypes. That Poodles are fussy and high maintenance, and that small dogs are, well, even more fussy and high maintenance.</p>
<p>In fact, a properly-raised Toy Poodle should have a similar disposition to a Standard Poodle, and the Standard Poodle was bred to work happily and productively alongside humans.</p>
<p>Toy Poodles should be active, proud and very smart (according to the AKC), and gay-spirited and good-tempered (according to the Kennel Club in the UK).</p>
<p>A Toy Poodle should be like a best friend who thinks all your ideas are excellent and wants to join in without fuss.</p>
<h3>Separation Anxiety</h3>
<p>Toy Poodles are popular companion dogs because they reciprocate our love of company.</p>
<p>But the flip side of this is that they don&#8217;t take kindly to being left out.</p>
<p>They are likely to become stressed and bored if they&#8217;re left alone in an empty house for long periods.<br />
<a name="training"></a><br />
If you work full time, factor in the cost of a pet sitter or regular dog walker when you&#8217;re deciding whether to get a Toy Poodle.</p>
<h2>Training and Exercising your Toy Poodle</h2>
<p>Many people think small dogs don’t have many requirements when it comes to training and exercise.</p>
<p>However, they’re mistaken!</p>
<p>Even smaller dogs like the Toy Poodle need consistent training and regular exercise!</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at what to expect.</p>
<h3>Exercise Requirements</h3>
<p>Don&#8217;t let their small size fool you – Toy Poodles are smart, energetic, and love to join in with days out.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll need to provide plenty of opportunities for exercise.</p>
<p>An hour a day is the absolute minimum. You&#8217;ll also need to keep them engaged with plenty of training and fun games at home.</p>
<h3>Trainability</h3>
<p>Historically Standard and even Miniature Poodles were prized for their quick intelligence and trainability as hunting companions.</p>
<p>Toy Poodles don&#8217;t share their older cousins&#8217; working roots, but they do share their intelligence.</p>
<p>With patience and practice, channeling those smarts into a well-trained and well-behaved dog should be an achievable and rewarding way to bond with your new dog.</p>
<h3>Socialization</h3>
<p>Like all toy dogs, Toy Poodles mustn&#8217;t be allowed to skip socializing or obedience training just because they&#8217;re small enough to scoop out of trouble.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6400" src="https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/poodle3.jpg" alt="toy poodle" width="1200" height="650" srcset="https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/poodle3.jpg 1200w, https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/poodle3-300x163.jpg 300w, https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/poodle3-768x416.jpg 768w, https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/poodle3-1024x555.jpg 1024w, https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/poodle3-740x400.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Lots of socialization as a puppy will be vital to instill them with the confidence they need around people as adults.</p>
<p>If your Toy Poodle will be visiting or visited by children, arranging a fun and rewarding introduction while they&#8217;re still a puppy will set them up for a happy relationship in the future.</p>

<h2>Toy Poodle Health and Care</h2>
<p>There are many factors that come under the puppy health and care bracket.<br />
<a name="grooming"></a><br />
Especially when you think of caring for that unique fur!</p>
<h3>Grooming Requirements</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re planning to enter your Toy Poodle into dog shows (or even if you just fancy the aesthetic of pom-poms at the ankles), then you&#8217;ll need to find a dog groomer with specific experience of looking after Poodles</p>
<p>They will initiate you into the fascinating and (dare I say it?) bewildering world of continental clips, English saddle clips and bikini clips.</p>
<p>They’ll help you identify which you&#8217;re allowed to choose from according to your chosen breed registry, and then choose which would be best for your Toy Poodle.</p>
<p>And if all this makes you think the that a corded coat might be the way to go, bear in mind they are the highest maintenance coat of all to keep clean.</p>
<p>But, before you despair, remind yourself that the time spent grooming your Toy Poodle would otherwise be spent hoovering up dog hairs and lint-rolling the furniture if you&#8217;d chosen a different breed of dog that sheds!</p>
<p><a href="https://thehappypuppysite.com/do-poodles-shed/">Here’s an article all about Poodles and shedding</a> if you want a closer look.</p>
<h3>General Health</h3>
<p>Through genetic good fortune and the wisdom and prudence of Toy Poodle breeders, there are lots of healthy Toy Poodles being born.</p>
<p>However, like any breed, there are some health problems which they tend to be vulnerable to.</p>
<p>Without further ado, they are:</p>
<h3>Progressive Retinal Atrophy</h3>
<p>Progressive Retinal Atrophy is a degenerative condition which causes the retina at the back of the eye to gradually degenerate. It eventually results in loss of sight.</p>
<p>Progressive Retinal Atrophy can be acquired through plain old bad luck. But it can also be caused by faulty genes which are inherited through some breeding lines of Toy Poodles.</p>
<p>Luckily, the faulty gene has been found, and carriers can be identified by a straightforward and easily obtainable DNA test.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<div class="catbook-image"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Happy-Cat-Handbook/dp/1785039326/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=happy+cat+handbook&amp;qid=1558714100&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=thehappypuppysite-20&amp;linkId=7af45b8858b22df1979f1031272e9de3&amp;language=en_US"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.thehappycatsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/catbook.jpeg" alt="the happy cat handbook" width="130" height="1177" /></a></div>
</div></div>

<p>When you visit a Toy Poodle puppy, their breeder should be able to show you certificates for both parents confirming they don&#8217;t carry the faulty gene which causes Progressive Retinal Atrophy.</p>
<h3>Cataracts</h3>
<p>A <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1463-5224.2005.00352.x/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huge retrospective study </a>of dogs diagnosed with cataracts between 1964 and 2003 found that just over 10% of Toy Poodles have cataracts, compared to just over 3% of the dog population overall.</p>
<p>This strongly suggests there is an underlying genetic link between being a Toy Poodle and suffering with cataracts. However, unlike Progressive Retinal Atrophy there is no definitive DNA test for identifying at-risk dogs.</p>
<p>So to screen for cataracts, all breeding Toy Poodles should have had a complete eye exam by a specialist veterinary ophthalmologist within the last year.</p>
<h3>Patella Luxation</h3>
<p>Patella luxation is a malformation of the knee joint which allows the top of the shin bone to slip in and out of position, causing lameness.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1524842/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luxating patellas </a>are a problem for many small dog breeds, including Toy Poodles.</p>
<p>There are different degrees of patella luxation, depending on whether it was present from birth or developed in adulthood, and how severely it affects the dog.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6402" src="https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/poodle4.jpg" alt="toy poodle" width="1200" height="1041" srcset="https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/poodle4.jpg 1200w, https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/poodle4-300x260.jpg 300w, https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/poodle4-768x666.jpg 768w, https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/poodle4-1024x888.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Toy Poodles used for breeding should have certificates issued by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals describing the condition of their knee joints.</p>
<p>The breeder should be happy to share these with you and discuss any concerns they throw up.</p>
<h3>von Willebrand&#8217;s Disease</h3>
<p>von Willebrand&#8217;s Disease, more commonly abbreviated to vWD, is an inherited blood disorder.</p>
<p>Dogs (and humans!) with vWD don&#8217;t produce enough of a protein in the blood plasma called von Willebrand factor (vWF).</p>
<p>vWF plays an important role in blood clotting when the skin is broken.</p>
<p>Dogs with vWD are prone to nosebleeds and bleeding gums, and bleed excessively from cuts or wounds in the skin.</p>
<p>The condition is caused by a mutation in the gene which would normally code for vWF. This means it can be inherited by puppies of Toy Poodles who carry the faulty gene.</p>
<p>Luckily, a DNA test for von Willebrand&#8217;s disease is readily available. When you visit a Toy Poodle puppy their breeder should be able to show you certificates to confirm neither parent carries the vWD mutation.</p>
<h3>Thyroid Problems</h3>
<p>And finally, all sizes of Poodle are more than averagely vulnerable to <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=71WmBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thyroid problems</a>.</p>
<p>This is a rather umbrella term which can refer to a broad spectrum of conditions and symptoms.</p>
<p>These can include, but aren&#8217;t limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>lethargy</li>
<li>weight gain</li>
<li>digestive problems</li>
<li>greasy skin, dry skin or skin infections</li>
<li>hair loss or a lank, greasy coat</li>
<li>and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you&#8217;re searching for your Toy Poodle puppy, ask breeders if any of the dogs in their puppies&#8217; family tree have been diagnosed with thyroid problems.</p>
<h2>How long do Toy Poodles live?</h2>
<p>A small sample of Toy Poodle owners in the UK who were willing to <a href="https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/media/16670/poodle%20(toy).pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete a survey for the Kennel Club </a>including details of how their pets had died (20 dogs in total), found that the average lifespan of those Toy Poodles had been 14 years and eight months.</p>
<p>Fourteen is a respectable age for any dog. It also reflects the general rule that small dogs tend to live longer than large dogs (the average age for Standard Poodles in the same survey was 12 years).</p>
<p>And pleasingly, the leading cause of death when the time came was simple old age.</p>
<h3>General Care</h3>
<p>As with any breed, you should check your Toy Poodles ears for excess wax regularly.</p>
<p>Also make sure to keep his nails trimmed.<br />
<a name="family"></a><br />
You’ll want to find a high quality dog food to ensure he grows into a happy and healthy adult!</p>
<h2>Do Toy Poodles make good family pets</h2>
<p>Toy Poodles are intelligent breeds that suit families who can spend a lot of time with them.</p>
<p>They don’t do well being left alone. And really benefit from time spend bonding whilst training or playing.</p>
<p>They suit families who have the time to exercise them regularly.</p>

<p>They don’t have too many severe health problems, which means they’re a relatively good choice for most families!</p>
<h3>Are Toy Poodles Good with Children?</h3>
<p>Standard and Miniature Poodles are a popular breed choice for families with children because they&#8217;re typically confident and relaxed around humans, and relatively easy to train.</p>
<p>Among Poodle owners, Toy Poodles are generally reported to be more nervous than their bigger cousins, which means kids will have to be older before they can be left unsupervised with a Toy Poodle.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also need to consider how likely it is that your Toy Poodle pup could accidentally get hurt.<br />
<a name="rescue"></a><br />
Most children will easily outweigh a Toy Poodle by their second birthday, but toddlers (through not fault of their own) are still clumsy, and if they fall onto your dog, the dog is likely to end up injured.</p>
<h2>Rescuing a Toy Poodle</h2>
<p>If you’re eager to welcome a Toy Poodle into your home, you can also consider rescue dogs.</p>
<p>Although you might not be able to find a puppy, choosing to go to a rescue is a great way to give a dog a second chance.</p>
<p>Toy Poodles end up in shelters or foster homes for all kind of reasons.</p>
<p>Some may have been given up for behavioral issues which an experienced dog owner is best-placed to rectify.</p>
<p>But others were much loved pets who have fallen on hard times, for example because their owner has died or become too ill to look after them.</p>
<p>Could you be the right person to give them a second shot at a happy home?<br />

<h2>Finding a Toy Poodle puppy</h2>
<p>Right, now you&#8217;ve got all the facts to help you choose the Toy Poodle breed, what&#8217;s the best way to find a Toy Poodle puppy?</p>
<p>Most Poodle breeders specialize in one chosen size of Poodle, and the <a href="http://www.akc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AKC</a> and <a href="http://www.poodlecluboramerica.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Poodle Club of America</a> both keep extensive details of Toy Poodle breeders.</p>
<p>In the UK the Kennel Club is a good starting place to find a Toy Poodle breeder in your area.</p>
<p>Poodles of all sizes are commonly mistaken for being hypoallergenic because they don&#8217;t shed (<a href="https://thehappypuppysite.com/hypoallergenic-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more on that here</a>) which means they&#8217;re a favorite of puppy farms.</p>
<p>It’s important to avoid puppy farms and pet stores, as these puppies and the dogs they’re bred from are not treated well.</p>
<p>Always take every precaution possible to make sure you buy your Toy Poodle puppy from a responsible breeder.</p>
<h3>Finding the Best Breeder</h3>
<p>A responsible breeder will be happy to answer <a href="https://thehappypuppysite.com/11-questions-to-ask-when-phoning-a-breeder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all these questions</a> when you approach them, and arrange for you to meet both parents before you take home your puppy.</p>
<p>Your prospective puppy should be with mum when you go to meet them, and it should be obvious she is a beloved family pet. She should know her name, and their should be obvious affection between her and the breeder (she has recently given birth after all!).</p>

<p>Worried that a pedigree Toy Poodle breeder is the wrong place to find a family pet?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be!</p>
<p>In reality only one or two puppies from a litter will be show standard, but the rest will still be happy, healthy, well-treated “pet puppies”.</p>
<h3>Toy Poodle price</h3>
<p>Bringing a litter of healthy puppies into the world is not a cheap business.</p>
<p>A Poodle puppy can cost anything from several hundred dollars to well over a thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Part of the cost might reflect that they are an unusual or sought-after color, or their parents have performed well in the show ring.</p>
<p>But the steep price tag is far from profiteering.</p>
<p>Their parents needed to be health tested before the mating took place, the mum needed veterinary care throughout her pregnancy, the puppies needed feeding, worming and flea-treating&#8230; it all adds up.</p>
<h3>Cheaper Toy Poodles</h3>
<p>If a Poodle puppy price sounds too good to be true, their welfare is likely to have been compromised at some point to make that possible.</p>
<p>Also bear in mind that even though a puppy seems expensive, the upfront cost is just a tiny fraction of how much you&#8217;ll have to pay to keep them over their lifetime.</p>
<p>We’ve broken down the <a href="https://thehappypuppysite.com/how-much-are-poodles/">cost of a Poodle puppy</a> for you, so you know what to expect.</p>

			<p>I am in PA, and I am looking for a small toy poodle puppy. I have had poodles all my life, and currently have just one, a 12-year-old little girl. She&#8217;s very frequently socialized with other dogs, and I think she&#8217;d be every happy with a little brother or sister.<br />

			<p>I bought a toy poodle recently from my mother&#8217;s friend. he&#8217;s a sweet little creature almost 3 months old and good with my 12 year old sister and 8 year old brother. he is a playful puppy who needs lot&#8217;s of attention and is also a bit sassy which is why i named him prince lol. i think toy poodle&#8217;s are great small dogs for the family and also a bit good with kids, my aunt has a male and female and she breeds them for a living, she recently had a baby who is now 6 months and her poodles get jealous the baby gets more attention than them, she says its easy to care for them and has no trouble grooming her two poodles</p>

			<p>Hi hope someone can help me or give me advies if we Made the right decision.<br />
Last weekend we went to a petshop to get a Toy poodle. Well, we ended up getting siblings (sisters). Emotional I am all for it but rational I am still doubting if I made the right decision. My kids and husband are very eager two have them both as they are so strongly attached to one another. Tearing them up would be so sad for them is what they say. But now my rational thought are taking over. Have we made a huge mistake? Are we taking to big of a step? Training two pups instead of one? Having double costs? I feel we have been too impulsive on one hand and then again on the other hand I feel we are doing a good thing. I have been reading on websites to NOT take two pups/siblings at the same time. So my rational feelings are confirmed. Can anyone tell me advise that what we are doing is good or not such a good idea? I looooooove dogs and I was instantly in love but I’m afraid I will cost me all my time&#8230;. please help me sort this out. Otherwise I need to call the pet shop tomorrow (I live in Singapore where you get most pets in a shop). Thanks for reading a helping. Sabine</p>

			<p>Dear Sabrine<br />
You have done an amazing thing in having two puppies. They are company for each other when you are not around. They are entertaining in that they will chase each other when you are outdoors or indoors. Think of them as two more children who do not need dressing and changing every day, but a lot more fun! Cuddling your poodles will make you so happy and relaxed. Brush them gently every week, play with them, listen to what they are telling you and take them for cool walks. They cost a LOT less than children and you can learn how to groom them at home. I LOVE all my poodles and they are like having little friends all around the house.</p>

			<p>Reputable breeders never sell two dogs at a time as pets. Why? It is too difficult to train two of them at the same time. They bond with each other instead of the owners and are less likely to listen. So you want to have the dog bond to you so it is anxious to please you. Also, the expense of two dogs is quite high. I have two dogs and the vet bills for just routine care is $2000 a year. Plus there is monthly grooming of $125. And I cook their food because one is a senior. So that is another $75 a month.</p>

			<p>No, you haven’t made a mistake at all!  I have an 8 year old Havanese and recently got a toy poodle puppy. I can’t imagine the poodle by herself. She loves her big brother and she spends a lot of time following him around and getting him to play with her. Toy poodles are just amazing, smart, funny lovable dogs. I would get another one if I could!</p>

			<p>I have a few questions. We are about to purchase a toy poodle within days. I&#8217;m nervous about not seeing her first. She will be coming via airplane ride. Is it possible that a cheap price is probably too good to be true? Also, is there a way to check to see if the breeders have the puppies best interest to heart. I don&#8217;t want to buy one from a puppy mill. Thanks I&#8217;ll be waiting patiently. For your answers. Thank you Bernadette</p>

			<p>as always if in doubt wait. ask questions. get pictures of pup and both parents. if the breeder won&#8217;t send pictures or answer your questions, back off. ask around. there are plenty of people that will point you to a good and reputable breeder. I got my little party girl from a great breeder that I found through my best friend who has 1 teacup poodle and 3 toys. I am so happy with her. I know that this reply is coming to you rather late, so I do hope you found the right match for you.</p>

			<p>My husband and I bought an 8 week old apricot toy poodle puppy. I instantly fell in love with him and he&#8217;s now going on 14 years of age. He&#8217;s healthy and energetic and eats twice a day. We had him neutered as a puppy and he&#8217;s only been to a vet since for his needle updates. He&#8217;s our heart and soul. He doesn&#8217;t bark when people arrive or leave being very quiet. His eyesight is worsening now and his hearing but is expected since he&#8217;ll be 14 in Nov. He&#8217;s very intelligent and easy to train. He loves our family and friends. Toy poodle is definitely our pick of small dogs due to their trainability and love of the family. They love other dogs and cats as well. Amazing dogs! He weighs approx 10 lbs. His Vet is amazed with his health. He is on adult canned food and we also feed him cooked veggies twice daily. I bathe, clip and clean his ears and do his nails myself.  Ollie is our pride and joy! Everyone who has met him falls in love with him. He has such a kind and loving personality. I do keep smaller kids away from him now as to protect him but he loves them still. I cannot imagine any other dog comparing with a toy poodle. I will replace him with another toy poodle when it&#8217;s time to part with him.</p>

			<p>My husband and I absolutely love poodles. We currently have a red head since she was 8 weeks old. She just under went her 2nd ruptured ACL and had an issue with her knee. all is healing well. We have our pets regularly checked at the vets . this is apparently just her issue with her legs. I believe now that she was a puppy mill puppy but wouldn&#8217;t trade her for anything. She is loveable but on her time , not yours. lol. very obsessed with HER property especially when it comes to my husband or our other poodle which she took the motherly instinct to. we weren&#8217;t quite sure if she would love him or chew him up when we brought him home. ( she truly loves the little guy) Our little boy on the other hand has the absolute most loveable disposition Ive ever seen in a dog. he is now 2 and he truly makes you love him because hes just hilarious. So, here you have my story on how poodles are the same but quite unique.  both raised as spoiled fur babies yet</p>

			<p>Dear Gloria V.</p>
<p>I’ve in search for a red head that stays red. Are you aware of your dog’s breeder by chance and is your poodle still red&#8230;?</p>
